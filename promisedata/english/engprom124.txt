31 traffic counselors consulted on civilian walking information
○ '15. 7.17. : Expert Advisory Meeting
○ October '15: Next
【Presentation result】
∘ It is already in operation for the nationwide pedestrian-related services.
Less useful even when providing walking-related data
∘Providing services from the public to the walking area is redundant with the private sector
○ Dec. Dec: Completion of information strategy planning (ISP) service
【Service result】
∘ Gait DB and walking information provision service are private
Investing in the city has problems such as redundancy.
Therefore,
It is sufficient to fulfill the pledge by simply implementing the walking information service using private information
⇨ Do not build a new MM Center
